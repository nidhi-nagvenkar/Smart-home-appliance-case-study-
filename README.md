Dodo is an AI-powered smart digital clock with an integrated calendar. It enables users to set reminders or
events using voice commands like:
"Hey Dodo, set an event 'Meeting with Nidhi' on 10th June at 5 PM."

Report Summary:
In today’s AI-powered world, Dodo offers a creative and practical implementation of artificial intelligence
within a smart home environment. It acts as a digital assistant embedded into a smart clock that also
functions as an intelligent calendar. The assistant's primary role is to manage voice-based event scheduling
and provide timely alerts through voice and display.

The system begins by displaying the real-time date and time. This default display mode ensures the device
remains informative even when no user interaction is happening. Once a voice command is given, Dodo
listens and checks whether the command includes a request to set an event. If it does, Dodo uses Natural
Language Processing (NLP) to extract important components such as the date, time, and event message.
The event is then stored.

Continuously running in the background, the assistant compares the current date and time with the saved
events. If an event is scheduled for the current time, Dodo will announce the event aloud and display it on
the screen. This alert system ensures the user is notified both visually and audibly.

If no events are due at the moment, Dodo simply continues to display the current time and date,
maintaining its core functionality as a digital clock. This ensures the assistant remains relevant and does not
sit idle.

The AI in Dodo is designed not only to execute basic voice commands but also to remain active and
responsive. For instance, in future iterations, Dodo could begin learning frequent event times and suggest
them based on past behavior—adding a layer of machine learning to an otherwise rule-based engine.

From an algorithmic point of view, the logic is structured into three primary phases: input capture, decision
processing, and output execution. Events are saved using a simple data structure, and a looping function
ensures Dodo remains active and responsive. The flowchart and pseudocode clearly demonstrate how
events are handled and how the assistant behaves during idle states.

This project shows how AI can enhance even the simplest daily tools—in this case, a clock—to create a
smarter, more interactive, and personalized experience. It integrates foundational AI concepts like NLP,
automation, and time-triggered functions. As more data is gathered through usage, Dodo could evolve into
a more predictive assistant capable of advanced reminders and smart suggestions.

In summary, Dodo combines simplicity with functionality, providing a meaningful demonstration of how AI
can be applied in real-world contexts. It transforms a static object into a dynamic, helpful assistant capable
of learning, interacting, and assisting based on real-time input. The project lays a strong foundation for
more advanced smart home applications while staying within the scope of basic AI implementation
principles.
